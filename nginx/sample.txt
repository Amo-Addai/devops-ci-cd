NGINX Load Balancing Overview
NGINX is a highly popular web server and reverse proxy server that also functions as a powerful load balancer. It helps distribute incoming client requests across multiple servers, ensuring better performance, scalability, and fault tolerance.

1. Key Features of NGINX Load Balancing
Load Balancing Algorithms:

Round Robin: Distributes requests evenly across servers in a sequential manner.
Least Connections: Sends requests to the server with the fewest active connections.
IP Hash: Ensures requests from the same client IP address go to the same server.
Custom Algorithms: Allows custom implementations using Lua or other NGINX modules.
Health Checks:

Monitors the status of backend servers and avoids sending traffic to unhealthy servers.
SSL Termination:

Offloads SSL/TLS encryption and decryption from backend servers to the load balancer.
Session Persistence:

Keeps users connected to the same server during a session using cookies or IP-based hashing.
Scalability:

Allows seamless scaling by adding or removing backend servers without downtime.
2. Installing NGINX
On Ubuntu/Debian:

bash

sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx
On CentOS/RHEL:

bash

sudo yum install nginx
Verify Installation:

bash

nginx -v
3. Configuring NGINX for Load Balancing
The configuration for load balancing in NGINX is done in its configuration file, typically located at /etc/nginx/nginx.conf or in a separate file within /etc/nginx/conf.d/.

Step 1: Basic Load Balancing Setup
Here’s a simple configuration for NGINX to load balance across three backend servers.

nginx.conf:

nginx

http {
    upstream backend_servers {
        server 192.168.1.101:80;
        server 192.168.1.102:80;
        server 192.168.1.103:80;
    }

    server {
        listen 80;
        
        location / {
            proxy_pass http://backend_servers;
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        }
    }
}

Explanation:
upstream backend_servers: Defines a group of backend servers.
proxy_pass http://backend_servers: Routes incoming requests to one of the backend servers.
Step 2: Using Load Balancing Algorithms
Modify the upstream block to implement specific algorithms:

Round Robin (default):

nginx

upstream backend_servers {
    server 192.168.1.101:80;
    server 192.168.1.102:80;
    server 192.168.1.103:80;
}
Least Connections:

nginx

upstream backend_servers {
    least_conn;
    server 192.168.1.101:80;
    server 192.168.1.102:80;
    server 192.168.1.103:80;
}
IP Hash:

nginx

upstream backend_servers {
    ip_hash;
    server 192.168.1.101:80;
    server 192.168.1.102:80;
    server 192.168.1.103:80;
}
Step 3: Adding Health Checks
To monitor backend server health, use the NGINX Plus module or third-party modules like ngx_http_healthcheck_module.

Example (NGINX Plus):

nginx

upstream backend_servers {
    server 192.168.1.101:80 max_fails=3 fail_timeout=30s;
    server 192.168.1.102:80 max_fails=3 fail_timeout=30s;
    server 192.168.1.103:80 max_fails=3 fail_timeout=30s;
}

Explanation:
max_fails: Number of failed attempts before marking the server as unhealthy.
fail_timeout: Time to wait before retrying an unhealthy server.
Step 4: SSL Termination
To offload SSL/TLS decryption:

nginx

http {
    upstream backend_servers {
        server 192.168.1.101:80;
        server 192.168.1.102:80;
    }

    server {
        listen 443 ssl;
        server_name example.com;

        ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/example.com.crt;
        ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/example.com.key;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://backend_servers;
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        }
    }
}

Explanation:
The SSL certificate and key are specified, and requests are forwarded to backend servers after decryption.
Step 5: Session Persistence
To ensure requests from the same client go to the same server:

nginx

upstream backend_servers {
    ip_hash;
    server 192.168.1.101:80;
    server 192.168.1.102:80;
}
Alternatively, use cookies:

nginx

upstream backend_servers {
    server 192.168.1.101:80;
    server 192.168.1.102:80;
    sticky cookie srv_id expires=1h domain=.example.com path=/;
}
4. Testing NGINX Load Balancing
After setting up the configuration:

Test the configuration for syntax errors:

bash

sudo nginx -t
Reload NGINX to apply changes:

bash

sudo systemctl reload nginx
Simulate traffic using a tool like curl or load testing tools like Apache JMeter or k6 to verify load distribution.

5. Advanced Features
Dynamic Configuration:

Use tools like Consul or etcd to dynamically update backend server configurations.
Caching:

Implement caching at the load balancer to reduce load on backend servers:
nginx

location / {
    proxy_cache my_cache;
    proxy_cache_valid 200 1h;
    proxy_pass http://backend_servers;
}
Rate Limiting:

Protect backend servers from being overwhelmed:
nginx

http {
    limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=mylimit:10m rate=10r/s;

    server {
        location / {
            limit_req zone=mylimit;
            proxy_pass http://backend_servers;
        }
    }
}
6. Conclusion
NGINX load balancing is a versatile and high-performance solution for distributing traffic across backend servers. It supports various algorithms, health checks, SSL termination, and session persistence, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. With these configurations, you can achieve a scalable, fault-tolerant infrastructure that can handle large-scale traffic efficiently.
